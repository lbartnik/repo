#' `connect_artifacts` can be called on the output of [read_artifacts]
#' to ensure that all artifacts become connected and can be turned into
#' a tree by calling [stratify]. It performs three operations:
#'
#'   * given the full graph of artifacts, it connects artifacts that
#'     are on a path in the graph (tree) but the intermediate nodes
#'     (artifacts) are not present in the container; this produces
#'     a __connected graph__
#'   * adds a `children` key to each element of the container
#'   * removes references to parents that cannot be reassigned to
#'     artifacts in the containers because no artifact until the very
#'     root of the full tree is present in the container
#'
#' @param artifacts `container` of artifacts; see [read_artifacts]

#'
#' Those lists are wrapped in a single list and named with values from `ids`.
#' Furthermore, `ancestry_graph` verifies that all values present in `parents`

#' connected, that is, whether there is a path between any pair of nodes.
