# Abstract

**Short-term design principle** is to simplify the occasional recall.
By recall we understand the ability to understand the origin or meaning
of a research artifact: data set, code, plot, model, etc[^recall]. In
the schematic view of exploratory data analysis[^dsloop] (see plot XX)
we aim to support the *Communicate* part.

We track the lineage of all artifacts created in the *Explore* loop and
we make the full explanation of their origin readily available upon user
request. Such artifact repository will be valuable whenever there is a
gap in the documentation of the analysis.

**Long-term goals** are to provide infrastructure and tools to automate
certain (semi-)manual tasks, like collecting, describing or organizing
artifacts. An important aspect of that work will be extending the current
text-only user interface with a graphical artifact browser.

# Introduction

Describe goals
and what is missing for each of them

The extent to which this will be a useful tool depends on how well a person manages the artifacts and the narrative of the project. If they do a good job at documenting their research and making it reproducible, then this repository might be only occasionally useful to them. If, however, they leave big gaps in their documentation and often lose parts of the lineage, having an automated tracker will be helpful.

 (e.g. JS app inside Shiny/RStudio) to effectively browse and work with the repository of artifacts.


# Future

## Graphical browser

Full inspection into history based on both expressions (commands) and
objects (artifacts) created by those expressions.

## Propose narratives

Identify the parts of the loop: ETL, exploration, models, model summary.
Might be called a *result*.
