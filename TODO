* handle mutable objects: dplyr 0.7.6 injects a number of attributes (e.g.
  "indices" on a grouped df) when seemingly unrelated operations are
  carried out on that df (e.g. ggplot()); this will be very confusing as
  repository will contain multiple copies of the same object, differing
  only by those extra, "dplyr-private" attributes

* describe objects in line, repo::describe

* store full info on R session (esp. loaded packages and their versions)

* generate artif. description upon write; do not read the whole object
  (only metadata) in repository_explain
