* `plot` tag cannot be exported bc it collides with graphics::plot

* handle mutable objects: dplyr 0.7.6 injects a number of attributes (e.g.
  "indices" on a grouped df) when seemingly unrelated operations are
  carried out on that df (e.g. ggplot()); this will be very confusing as
  repository will contain multiple copies of the same object, differing
  only by those extra, "dplyr-private" attributes

* describe objects in line, repo::describe

* store full info on R session (esp. loaded packages and their versions);
  store session id in a private environment variable, not via options()

* generate artif. description upon write; do not read the whole object
  (only metadata) in repository_explain

* fix tree printout: even if objects are filtered out, tree should remain
  consistent; it can only mark missing link with a different collor or
  e.g. dashed line

* provide pretty query API: inherits("class") instead of "class" %in% class
  storage::os_find will need to accept a new `env` parameter with those
  extra search API calls
