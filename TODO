* create a Docker image with all the third-party libraries pre-installed
  and everything ready for work, without the need to compile all the
  dependencies, esp. imager and its dependencies

* refactoring:
  - move code operating on language into language.R
  - refactor many_repository and test in in test-helpers.R to see if its
    output conforms with is_valid_commit and is_valid_artifact
  - merge new and old code in commit.R
  - merge the implementation ancestor_of() for commits and artifacts

* use `parents` istead of `parent` in commit's tags

* `plot` tag cannot be exported bc it collides with graphics::plot

* handle mutable objects: dplyr 0.7.6 injects a number of attributes (e.g.
  "indices" on a grouped df) when seemingly unrelated operations are
  carried out on that df (e.g. ggplot()); this will be very confusing as
  repository will contain multiple copies of the same object, differing
  only by those extra, "dplyr-private" attributes

* describe objects in line, repo::describe

* store full info on R session (esp. loaded packages and their versions);
  store session id in a private environment variable, not via options()

* fix tree printout: even if objects are filtered out, tree should remain
  consistent; it can only mark missing link with a different collor or
  e.g. dashed line

* provide pretty query API: inherits("class") instead of "class" %in% class
  storage::os_find will need to accept a new `env` parameter with those
  extra search API calls

* when storing compound artifacts (e.g. lm) extract its dependencies
  (e.g. the input data) and store an object-store reference instead of
  the full artifact (e.g. in the case of lm this will greatly reduce the
  size of the artifact)
