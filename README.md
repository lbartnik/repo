calls to create a new repository, append artifacts to a repository,
search for artifacts given their tag values.

  * [storage](https://github.com/lbartnik/storage) - store of R objects
  * [defer](https://github.com/lbartnik/defer) - building and processing closures of R functions and data

Revert depends on:
  * [ui](https://github.com/lbartnik/ui) - text-based user interface


# Documentation

  * [user interface tutorial](https://lbartnik.github.io/ui/)
  * [work plan](https://lbartnik.github.io/repository/)
  * [graphical object browser](https://lbartnik.github.io/experiment/), an older attempt
